# Play With Charts

PoC project aims to get some experience with data visusalization in react.

App has been bootstraped with Create React App.

## How to run?

1. Clone the repository
2. run `npm start` command.

It launches react-scripts and json-server which is kind of "fake backend" because the only thing it does is providing JSON data in response to http request.
